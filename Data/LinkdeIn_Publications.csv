1,Angelos Stavrou,Privacy Risk Assessment on Online PhotosPrivacy,"With the rising popularity of cameras and people's increasing desire to share photos, an overwhelming number of photos have been posted all over the Web. A digital photo usually contains much information in its metadata. Once published online, a photo could disclose much more information beyond what is visually depicted in the photo and what the owner expects to share. The metadata contained in digital photos could pose significant privacy threats to their owners. Our work aims to raise public awareness of privacy risks resulting from sharing photos online and subsequent photo handling conducted by contemporary media sites. To this end, we investigated the prevalence of metadata information among digital photos and assessed the potential privacy risks arising from the metadata information. We also studied the policies adopted by online media sites on handling the metadata information embedded in the photos they host. We examined nearly 100,000 photos collected from over 600 top-ranked websites in seven categories and found that the photo handling policy adopted by a site largely varies depending on the category of the site. We demonstrated that some trivial looking metadata information suffices to mount real-world attacks against photo owners.",1-Jan-15

1,Brittany Johnson-Matthews,Bespoke Tools: Adapted to the Concepts Developers Know,"Even though dierent developers have varying levels of expertise, the tools in one developer's integrated development environment (IDE) behave the same as the tools in every other developers' IDE. In this paper, we propose the idea of automatically customizing development tools by modeling what a developer knows about software concepts. We then sketch three such bespoke tools and describe how development data can be used to infer what a developer knows about relevant concepts. Finally, we describe our ongoing efforts to make bespoke program analysis tools that customize their notications to the developer using them.",ESEC/FSE 2015 Proceedings
2,Brittany Johnson-Matthews,Novice Understanding of Program Analysis Tool Notifications,"Program analysis tools are available to make programmers’ jobs easier by automating tasks that would otherwise be performed manually or not at all. To communicate with the programmer, these tools use notiﬁcations, which may be textual, visual, or a combination of both. Research has shown that these notiﬁcations need improvement in two areas: expressiveness and scalability. In the research described here, I begin an investigation into the expressiveness and scalability of existing program analysis tools and potential improvements in expressiveness and scalability in and across these tools",ICSE 2013 ACM Student Research Competition
3,Brittany Johnson-Matthews,Why Don't Software Developers Use Static Analysis Tools to Find Bugs?,"Using static analysis tools for automating code
inspections can be beneﬁcial for software engineers. Such tools
can make ﬁnding bugs, or software defects, faster and cheaper
than manual inspections. Despite the beneﬁts of using static
analysis tools to ﬁnd bugs, research suggests that these tools
are underused. In this paper, we investigate why developers
are not widely using static analysis tools and how current tools
could potentially be improved. We conducted interviews with 20
developers and found that although all of our participants felt
that use is beneﬁcial, false positives and the way in which the
warnings are presented, among other things, are barriers to use.
We discuss several implications of these results, such as the need
for an interactive mechanism to help developers ﬁx defects.",ICSE 2013 Proceedings

0,Colin Reagle,Study of Microparticle Rebound Characteristics Under High Temperature Conditions,"Large amounts of tiny microparticles are ingested into gas turbines over their operating life, resulting in unexpected wear and tear. Knowledge of such microparticle behavior at gas turbine operating temperatures is limited in published literature. In this study, Arizona road dust (ARD) is injected into a hot flow field to measure the effects of high temperature and velocity on particle rebound from a polished 304 stainless steel (SS) coupon. The results are compared with baseline (27 m/s) measurements at ambient (300 K) temperature made in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig, as well as previously published literature. Mean coefficient of restitution (COR) was shown to decrease with the increased temperature/velocity conditions in the VT Aerothermal Rig. The effects of increasing temperature and velocity led to a 12% average reduction in COR at 533 K (47 m/s), 15% average reduction in COR at 866 K (77 m/s), and 16% average reduction in COR at 1073 K (102 m/s) compared with ambient results. The decrease in COR appeared to be almost entirely a result of increased velocity that resulted from heating the flow. Trends show that temperature plays a minor role in energy transfer between particle and impact surface below a critical temperature.",21-Oct-13
1,Colin Reagle,Measuring the coefficient of restitution of high speed microparticle impacts using a PTV and CFD hybrid technique,"A novel particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) hybrid method for measuring coefficient of restitution (COR) has been developed which is relatively simple, cost-effective, and robust. A laser and camera system is used in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig to measure velocity trajectories of microparticles. The method solves for particle impact velocity at the impact surface using a CFD solution and Lagrangian particle tracking. The methodology presented here attempts to characterize a difficult problem by a combination of established techniques, PTV and CFD, which have not been used in this capacity before. Erosion and deposition are functions of particle/wall interactions and COR is a fundamental property of these interactions. COR depends on impact velocity, angle of impact, temperature, particle composition, and wall material. Two sizes of Arizona road dust and one size of glass beads are impacted on to a 304 stainless steel coupon. The particles are entrained into a free jet of 27 m s−1 at room temperature. Impact angle was varied from 85° to 25° depending on particle. Mean results collected using this new technique compare favorably with trends established in literature. The utilization of this technique to measure COR of microparticle sand will help develop a computational model and serve as a baseline for further measurements at elevated air and wall temperatures.",4-Sep-13
2,Colin Reagle,Sand Transport in a Two Pass Internal Cooling Duct with Rib Turbulators,"A two pass stationary square duct with rib turbulators subjected to sand ingestion is studied using Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Each pass has ribs on two opposite walls and aligned normal to the main flow direction. The rib pitch to rib height (P/e) is 9.28, the rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) is 0.0625 and calculations have been carried out for a bulk Reynolds number of 25,000. Particle sizes in the range 0.5–25 μm are considered, with the same size distribution as found in Arizona Road Dust (medium). Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with wall-model is used to model the flow and sand particles are modeled using a discrete Lagrangian framework. 220,000 particles are injected at the inlet and perfectly elastic collisions with the wall are considered. Results quantify the distribution of particle impingement density on all surfaces. Highest particle impingement density is found in the first quarter section of the second pass after the 180° turn, where the recorded impingement is more than twice that of any other region. It is also found that the average particle impingement per pitch is 28% higher in the second pass than the first pass. Results show lower particle tendency to hit the region immediately behind the rib in the first pass compared to the second pass where particle impingement is more uniform in the region between two ribs. The smooth walls do not show much particle impingement except the wall in second pass where the flow impinges after the turn. The rib face facing the flow is by far is the most susceptible to impingement and hence deposition and erosion. The results of this simulation were also compared with results obtained from experiments conducted on an identical two pass geometry with Arizona Road Dust particles. The particle impingement pattern is recorded by using a sticky tape on all surfaces to capture the particles. The numerical predictions showed good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements.",8-Jul-12
3,Colin Reagle,A Transient Infrared Technique for Measuring Surface Heat Transfer In A Transonic Turbine Cascade,"This paper describes a method for obtaining surface and endwall heat transfer in an uncooled transonic cascade facility using infrared thermography measurements. Midspan heat transfer coefficient results are first presented for an engine representative first stage nozzle guide vane at exit Mach number of 0.77, Reynolds number of 1.05×106 and freestream turbulence intensity of 16%. The results obtained from infrared thermography are compared with previously published results using thin film gauges in the same facility on the same geometry. There is generally good agreement between the two measurement techniques in both trend and overall level of heat transfer coefficient over the vane surface. Stanton number contours are then presented for a blade endwall at exit Mach number of 0.88, Reynolds number of 1.70×106 and freestream turbulence intensity of 8%. Infrared thermography results are qualitatively compared with results from a published work obtained with liquid crystals at similar flow conditions. Results are qualitatively in agreement.",14-Jun-10

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and standardization bodies that hold jurisdiction in other countries continuously update blood transfusion safety mandates. Verifying blood bank processes for safety takes labor and time.

The vendor diversity on the market accentuates the need to make these systems interoperable, i.e., able to compare fingerprints collected using different devices with comparable high accuracy.
In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme for enhancing interoperability between optical fingerprint sensors. Different features (i.e. image quality, texture) and signal domains (space and frequency) are utilized to compensate for the variations in cross-sensor recognition performance of a commercial matcher.
Specifically, we consider Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and characteristics derived from the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
DWT is able to preserve spatial information of an image when performing frequency analysis while BSIF has shown to be an effective local descriptor for images with unusual characteristics. Experiments are carried out on a data set consisting of fingerprints obtained from 494 users acquired using four different optical devices. Results show a significant reduction in error rates compared to the baseline as well as improved performance compared to previous research.",The 15th International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group BIOSIG 2016

This name collision attack can cause all web traffic of an Internet user to be redirected to a MitM proxy automatically right after the launching of a standard browser. ... We discuss promising directions for remediation at the new gTLD registry, Autonomous System (AS), and end user levels, and use empirical data analysis to estimate and compare their effectiveness and deployment difficulties.",1-May-16
2,Eric Osterweil,The Shape and Size of Threats: Defining a Networked System's Attack Surface,"As more complex security services have been added to today’s Internet, it becomes increasingly difficult to quantify their vulnerability to compromise. The concept of “attack surface” has emerged in recent years as a measure of such vulnerabilities, however systematically quantifying the attack surfaces of networked systems remains an open challenge. In this work we propose a methodology
to both quantify the attack surface and visually represent semantically different components (or resources) of such systems by identifying their dependencies. To illustrate the efficacy of our methodology, we examine two real Internet standards (the X.509 CA verification system and DANE)
as case studies. We believe this work represents a first step towards systemically modeling dependencies of (and interdependencies between) networked systems, and shows the usability benefits from leveraging existing services. ",21-Oct-14
3,Eric Osterweil,Measuring IPv6 Adoption,"The Internet is on the verge of its first fundamentally-disruptive transition—one which will impose extensive change throughout the network. On February 3, 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocated the last unallocated blocks of IPv4 address space to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), accelerating pressure for migration to the next version of the Internet protocol, IPv6. This inflection point offers a unique opportunity to study the adoption of new technologies at an unprecedented scale. In this paper, we provide measurement of this significant transition. Unlike existing studies, which are limited to specific IPv6 characteristics or time scales, our goal is to create a comprehensive and longitudinal picture of IPv6 adoption. Using large, global-scale datasets, we assemble measurements encompassing the important aspects of adoption, including both new and previously-proposed measures. Spanning a period of almost ten years, these metrics include numerous notable adoption milestones, such as the recent World IPv6 Launch event in June of 2012 and the European RIR’s IPv4 address exhaustion in September of that year.",12-Aug-14
4,Eric Osterweil,Verifying Keys through Publicity and Communities of Trust: Quantifying Off-Axis Corroboration,"The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) arguably make DNS the first core Internet system to be protected using public key cryptography. The success of DNSSEC not only protects the DNS, but has generated interest in using this secured global database for new services such as those proposed by the IETF DANE working group. However, continued success is only possible if several important operational issues can be addressed. For example, .gov and .arpa have already suffered misconfigurations where DNS continued to function properly, but DNSSEC failed (thus, orphaning their entire subtrees in DNSSEC). Internet-scale verification systems must tolerate this type of chaos, but what kind of verification can one derive for systems with dynamism like this? In this paper, we propose to achieve robust verification with a new theoretical model, called Public Data, which treats operational deployments as Communities of Trust (CoTs) and makes them the verification substrate. Using a realization of the above idea, called Vantages, we quantitatively show that using a reasonable DNSSEC deployment model and a typical choice of a CoT, an adversary would need to be able to have visibility into and perform on-path Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on arbitrary traffic into and out of up to 90 percent of the all of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet before having even a 10 percent chance of spoofing a DNSKEY. Further, our limited deployment of Vantages has outperformed the verifiability of DNSSEC and has properly validated its data up to 99.5 percent of the time.",1-Feb-14

The attackers hijacked clicks and ad impressions on victim machines infected by a DNS changer malware to earn ad revenue fraudulently. We experimented with the attack infrastructure when it was in operation and present a detailed account of the attackers' modus operandi. We also study the impact of this attack on real-world users and find that 37 subscriber lines were impacted in our data set. Also, 20 ad networks and 257 legitimate Web content publishers lost ad revenue while the attackers earned revenue convincing a dozen other ad networks that their ads were served on websites with real visitors. Our work expands the understanding of modalities of ad fraud and could help guide appropriate defense strategies.",1-Dec-13
7,Eric Osterweil,"Behavior of DNS’ Top Talkers, a .com / .net View","This paper provides the first systematic study of DNS data taken from one of the 13 servers for the .com / .net registry. DNS’ generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) such .com and .net serve resolvers from throughout the Internet and respond to billions of DNS queries every day. This study uses gTLD data to characterize the DNS resolver population and profile DNS query types. The results show a small and relatively stable set of resolvers (i.e. the top-talkers) constitute 90% of the overall traffic. The results provide a basis for understanding for this critical Internet service, insights on typical resolver behaviors and the use of IPv6 in DNS, and provides a foundation for further study of DNS behavior.",1-Mar-12
8,Eric Osterweil,Reducing the X.509 Attack Surface with DNSSEC's DANE,"For the last decade, perhaps the most commonly used type of end-user security has been the HTTP Secure (HTTPS) protocol employed by web browsers (which runs over the Secure Sockets Layer, SSL or its successor, TLS). In HTTPS, any service (such as a website) may create its own cryptographic certificate to secure its communication channel, and clients use this certificate to verify data from, and transmit data to the server. This model has helped to secure online banking transactions, eCommerce websites, social networking websites, and more. However, two inherent complications to this approach are that clients must have a secure way to learn the authentic certificate for each website before they begin using this protocol, and they must be able to determine if they can trust the named entity that the certificate belongs to. These complications are conflated in today’s security model, which is based on a list of prespecified trusted X.509 Certificate
Authorities (CAs) that every client must know a priori, and a very ad-hoc approach to determining which of this list of CAs will vouch for any keys discovered.

In this paper we first outline some of the fundamental problems that exist with today’s CA model, problems that arise from its conflation of the two inherent complications, and some of the implications and attack vectors that these problems present to the security of this model’s users. Then we introduce some of the relative benefits that can be gained from a new approach being standardized in the IETF called DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), in which certificate credentials are verified by DNSSEC-enabled zones, rather than the CA model used today. We illustrate that
the DNSSEC-verification model reduces the attack surface that users currently inherit, and show that this model opens avenues that have previously remained elusive (such as a usable S/MIME verification infrastructure).",1-Mar-12
9,Eric Osterweil,The Great IPv4 Land Grab: Resource Certification for the IPv4 Grey Market,"The era of free IPv4 address allocations has ended and the grey market in IPv4 addresses is now emerging. This paper argues that one cannot and should not try to regulate who sells addresses and at what price, but one does need to provide some proof of ownership in the form of resource certification. In this paper we identify key requirements of resource certification, gained from both theoretical analysis and operational history. We further argue these requirements
can be achieved by making use of the existing reverse DNS hierarchy, enhanced with DNS Security. Our analysis compares reverse DNS entries and BGP routing tables and shows this is both feasible and achievable today; an essential requirement as the grey market is also emerging today and solutions are needed now, not years in the future.",1-Nov-11

11,Eric Osterweil,Cross-Modal Vulnerabilities: An Illusive form of Hijacking,"Content, connection, and other types of hijacking are a common occurrence in todayÂ’s Internet. One can broadly classify various types of hijacks as being locally scoped to an administrative domain, or pushed externally; where one administrative domain (intentionally or unintentionally) hijacks users in other domains. Current work in identifying and reacting to various types of Internet hijacking has focused on the network control plane and has not included cross-modal hijacks that involve both the control plane and the data plane of the Internet. In this work we introduce the idea that cross-modal threats exist in the Internet and form a highly illusive, but serious threat. Further, we detail an actual instance of Internet-scale cross-modal hijacking whose behavior depends on both network control data and data plane such as the order in which users request connections. Based on anecdotal evidence gleaned from several websites, it appears that this hijack existed for many months (and possibly years) before its recent detection.",1-Mar-10
12,Eric Osterweil,Deploying Cryptography in Internet-Scale Systems: A Case Study on DNSSEC,"The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are among the first attempts to deploy cryptographic protections in an Internet-scale operational system. DNSSEC applies well-established public key cryptography to ensure data integrity and origin authenticity in the DNS system. While the cryptographic design of DNSSEC is sound and seemingly simple, its development has taken the IETF over a decade and several protocol revisions, and even today its deployment is still in the early stage of rolling out. In this paper, we provide the first systematic examination of the design, deployment, and operational challenges encountered by DNSSEC over the years. Our study reveals a fundamental gap between cryptographic designs and operational Internet systems. To be deployed in the global Internet, a cryptographic protocol must possess several critical properties including scalability, flexibility, incremental deployability, and ability to function in face of imperfect operations. We believe that the insights gained from this study can offer valuable inputs to future cryptographic designs for other Internet-scale systems.",1-Jan-10

16,Eric Osterweil,Quantifying the Operational Status of the DNSSEC Deployment,"This paper examines the deployment of the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which add cryptographic protection to DNS, one of the core components in the Internet infrastructure. We analyze the data collected from the initial DNSSEC deployment which started over 2 years ago, and identify three critical metrics to gauge the deployment: availability, verifiability, and validity. Our results provide the first comprehensive look at DNSSEC’s deployment and reveal a number of challenges that were not anticipated in the design but have become evident in the deployment. First, obstacles such as middle-boxes (firewalls, NATs, etc.) that exist in today’s Internet infrastructure have proven to be problematic and have resulted in unforeseen availability problems. Second, the public-key delegation system of DNSSEC has not evolved as it was hoped and it currently leaves over 97% of DNSSEC zones isolated and unverifiable, unless some external key authentication mechanism is added. Furthermore, our results show that cryptographic verification is not equivalent to validation; a piece of verified data can still contain the wrong value. Finally, our results demonstrate the essential role of monitoring and measurement in the DNSSEC deployment. We believe that the observations and lessons from the DNSSEC deployment can provide insights into measuring future Internet-scale cryptographic systems.",10-Oct-08
17,Eric Osterweil,Limiting Replay Vulnerabilities in DNSSEC,"The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) added public key cryptography to the DNS, but problems remain in selecting signature lifetimes. A zone’s master server distributes signatures to secondary servers. The signatures lifetimes should be long so that a secondary server can still operate if the master fails. However, DNSSEC lacks revocation. Signed data can be replayed until the signature expires and thus zones should select a short signature lifetime. Operators must choose between reduced robustness or long replay vulnerability windows.

This paper introduces a revised DNSSEC signature that allows secondary servers to operate even if the master has failed while simultaneously limiting replay windows to twice the TTL. Each secondary server constructs a hash chain and relays the hash chain anchor to the master server. The signature produced by the master server ensures the authenticity of the hash anchor and the DNS data. A secondary server includes both the signature and a hash chain value used by resolvers to limit signature replay. Our implementation shows the added costs are minimal compared to DNSSEC and ensures robustness against long-term master server failures. At the same time, we limit replay to twice the record TTL value.",1-Oct-08

However the current design lacks a key revocation mechanism. In this paper we present Zone State Revocation (ZSR), a lightweight and backward compatible enhancement to DNSSEC. ZSR enables zones to explicitly revoke keys using self-certifying certificates, and enables DNS name-servers to opportunistically inform distributed caching resolvers of key revocations via lightweight control messages. Further, ZSR allows resolvers to distinguish between legitimate key changes and potential attacks when authentication chains are broken. ZSR is designed to work well with global-scale DNS operations, where millions of caches may need to be informed of a revocation, and where time is critical.",1-Aug-07

0,Hemant Purohit,Gender-Based Violence in 140 Characters or Fewer: A #BigData Case Study of Twitter,"Humanitarian and public institutions are increasingly relying on data from social media sites to measure public attitude, and provide timely public engagement. Such engagement supports the exploration of public views on important social issues such as gender-based violence (GBV). In this study, we examine Big (Social) Data consisting of nearly fourteen million tweets collected from the Twitter platform over a period of ten months to analyze public opinion regarding GBV, highlighting the nature of tweeting practices by geographical location and gender. The exploitation of Big Data requires the techniques of Computational Social Science to mine insight from the corpus while accounting for the influence of both transient events and sociocultural factors. We reveal public awareness regarding GBV tolerance and suggest opportunities for intervention and the measurement of intervention effectiveness assisting both governmental and non-governmental organizations in policy development.

1,Hemant Purohit,Intent Classification of Short-text Social Media,"Social media platforms facilitate the emergence of citizen communities that discuss real-world events, and generate/share content with a variety of intent ranging from social good (e.g., volunteering to help) to commercial interest (e.g., criticizing product features). Hence, mining intent from social data can aid in filtering social media to support organizations, such as an emergency management unit for resource planning. However, effective intent mining is inherently challenging due to ambiguity in interpretation, and sparsity of relevant behaviors in social data. In this research, we address the problem of multiclass classification of intent with a use-case of social data generated during crisis events. Our novel interdisciplinary method exploits a hybrid feature representation created by combining top-down processing using knowledge-guided patterns with bottom-up processing using a bag-of-tokens model.

2,Hemant Purohit,Assisting Coordination during Crisis: A Domain Ontology based Approach to Infer Resource Needs from Tweets,"Ubiquitous social media during crises provides citizen reports on the situation, needs and supplies. Previous research extracts resource needs directly from the text (e.g. “Power cut to Coney Island and Brighton beach” indicates a power need). This approach assumes that citizens derive and write about specific needs from their observations, properly specified for the emergency response system, an assumption that is not consistent with general conversational behavior. In our study, Twitter messages (tweets) from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 clearly indicate power blackouts, but not their probable implications (e.g. loss of power to hospital life support systems). We use a domain model to capture such interdependencies between resources and needs. We represent these dependencies in an ontology that specifies the functional association between resources. Accurate interpretation of resource need/supply also depends on the location of a message. We show how inference based on a domain model combined with location detection and interpretation in the social data can enhance situational awareness, e.g., predicting a medical emergency before it is reported as critical.",1-Jun-14

0,Jeffrey Moran,Noble-gas-infused neoprene closed-cell foams achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity fabrics,"Closed-cell foams are widely applied as insulation and essential for the thermal management of protective garments for extreme environments. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a strategy for drastically reducing the thermal conductivity of a flexible, closed-cell polychloroprene foam to 0.031 ± 0.002 W m−1 K−1, approaching values of an air gap (0.027 W m−1 K−1) for an extended period of time (>10 hours), within a material capable of textile processing. Ultra-insulating neoprene materials are synthesized using high-pressure processing at 243 kPa in a high-molecular-weight gas environment, such as Ar, Kr, or Xe. A Fickian diffusion model describes both the mass infusion and thermal conductivity reduction of the foam as a function of processing time, predicting a 24–72 hour required exposure time for full charging of a 6 mm thick 5 cm diameter neoprene sample. These results enable waterproof textile insulation that approximates a wearable air gap. We demonstrate a wetsuit made of ultra-low thermally conductive neoprene capable of potentially extending dive times to 2–3 hours in water below 10 °C, compared with <1 hour for the state-of-the-art. This work introduces the prospect of effectively wearing a flexible air gap for thermal protection in harsh environments.",18-Jun-18
1,Jeffrey Moran,Numerical study of the effect of soft layer properties on bacterial electroporation,"We present a numerical model of electroporation in a gram-positive bacterium, which accounts for the presence of a negatively charged soft polyelectrolyte layer (which may include a periplasmic space, peptidoglycan layer, cilia, flagella, and other surface appendages) surrounding its plasma membrane. We model the ion transport within and outside the soft layer using the soft layer electrokinetics-based Poisson-Nernst-Planck formalism. Additionally, we model the electroporation dynamics on the plasma membrane using the pore nucleation-based electroporation formalism developed by Krassowska and Filev. We find that ion transport within the soft layer (surface conduction), which depends on the relative importance of the soft layer charged group concentration compared to the buffer concentration, significantly alters the transmembrane voltage across the plasma membrane and hence the pore characteristics. Our numerical simulations suggest that surface conduction significantly lowers the pore number in the plasma membrane. This observation is consistent with experimental studies that show that gram-positive bacteria, in general, have lower transformation efficiencies compared to gram-negative bacteria. Our studies highlight a strong dependence of bacterial electroporation on cell envelope properties and buffer conditions, which need to be taken into consideration when designing electroporation protocols.",18-Sep-17
2,Jeffrey Moran,Phoretic Self-Propulsion,"It is well-known that micro- and nanoparticles can move by phoretic effects in response to externally imposed gradients of scalar quantities such as chemical concentration or electric potential. A class of active colloids can propel themselves through aqueous media by generating local gradients of concentration and electrical potential via surface reactions. Phoretic active colloids can be controlled using external stimuli and can mimic collective behaviors exhibited by many biological swimmers. Low–Reynolds number physicochemical hydrodynamics imposes unique challenges and constraints that must be understood for the practical potential of active colloids to be realized. Here, we review the rich physics underlying the operation of phoretic active colloids, describe their interactions and collective behaviors, and discuss promising directions for future research.",1-Jan-17
3,Jeffrey Moran,Nonlinear electrophoresis in the presence of dielectric decrement,"The nonlinear phenomena that occur in the electric double layer (EDL) that forms at charged surfaces strongly influence electrokinetic effects, including electro-osmosis and electrophoresis. In particular, saturation effects due to either dielectric decrement or ion crowding effects are of paramount importance. Dielectric decrement significantly influences the ionic concentration in the EDL at high zeta potential, leading to the formation of a condensed layer near the particle's surface. In this article, we present a model incorporating both steric effects due to the finite size of ions and dielectric decrement to describe the physics in the electric double layer. The model remains valid in both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes, as long as the electric double layer remains in quasiequilibrium. We apply this model to the study of two archetypal problems in electrokinetics, namely the electrophoresis of particles with fixed surface charges and the electrophoresis of ideally polarizable particles.",30-Aug-16
4,Jeffrey Moran,Microfluidic Screening of Electric Fields for Electroporation,"Electroporation is commonly used to deliver molecules such as drugs, proteins, and/or DNA into cells, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work a rapid microfluidic assay was developed to determine the critical electric field threshold required for inducing bacterial electroporation. The microfluidic device was designed to have a bilaterally converging channel to amplify the electric field to magnitudes sufficient to induce electroporation. The bacterial cells are introduced into the channel in the presence of SYTOX®, which fluorescently labels cells with compromised membranes. Upon delivery of an electric pulse, the cells fluoresce due to transmembrane influx of SYTOX® after disruption of the cell membranes. We calculate the critical electric field by capturing the location within the channel of the increase in fluorescence intensity after electroporation. Bacterial strains with industrial and therapeutic relevance such as Escherichia coli BL21 (3.65 ± 0.09 kV/cm), Corynebacterium glutamicum (5.20 ± 0.20 kV/cm), and Mycobacterium smegmatis (5.56 ± 0.08 kV/cm) have been successfully characterized. Determining the critical electric field for electroporation facilitates the development of electroporation protocols that minimize Joule heating and maximize cell viability. This assay will ultimately enable the genetic transformation of bacteria and archaea considered intractable and difficult-to-transfect, while facilitating fundamental genetic studies on numerous diverse microbes.",19-Feb-16
5,Jeffrey Moran,Nonlinear electrophoresis of ideally polarizable particles,"We focus in this paper on the nonlinear electrophoresis of ideally polarizable particles. At high applied voltages, significant ionic exchange occurs between the electric double layer, which surrounds the particle, and the bulk solution. In addition, steric effects due to the finite size of ions drastically modify the electric potential distribution in the electric double layer. In this situation, the velocity field, the electric potential, and the ionic concentration in the immediate vicinity of the particle are described by a complicated set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In
the general case, these equations must be solved numerically. In this study, we rely on a numerical approach to determine the electric potential, the ionic concentration, and the velocity field in the bulk solution surrounding the particle. The numerical simulations rely on a pseudo-spectral method which was used successfully by Chu and Bazant [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 315 (1), 319–329 (2007)] to determine the electric potential and the ionic concentration around an ideally polarizable metallic
sphere. Our numerical simulations also incorporate the steric model developed by Kilic
et al. [Phys. Rev. E 75, 021502 (2007)] to account for crowding effects in the electric double layer, advective transport, and for the presence of a body force in the bulk electrolyte. The simulations demonstrate that surface conduction significantly decreases the electrophoretic mobility of polarizable particles at high zeta potential and at high applied electric field. Advective transport in the electric double layer and in the bulk solution is also shown to significantly impact surface conduction.",9-Oct-14
6,Jeffrey Moran,Role of solution conductivity in reaction induced charge auto-electrophoresis,"Catalytic bimetallic Janus particles swim by a bipolar electrochemical propulsion mechanism that results from electroosmotic fluid slip around the particle surface. The flow is driven by electrical body forces which are generated from a coupling of a reaction-induced electric field and net charge in the diffuse layer surrounding the particle. This paper presents simulations, scaling, and physical descriptions of the experimentally observed trend that the swimming speed decays rapidly with increasing solution conductivity. The simulations solve the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations with multiple ionic species, a cylindrical particle in an infinite fluid, and nonlinear Butler-Volmer boundary conditions to represent the electrochemical surface reactions. The speed of bimetallic particles is reduced in high-conductivity solutions because of reductions in the induced electric field in the diffuse layer near the rod, the total reaction rate, and the magnitude of the rod zeta potential. This work suggests that the auto-electrophoretic mechanism is inherently susceptible to speed reductions in higher ionic strength solutions.",1-Apr-14
7,Jeffrey Moran,Three-dimensional three-component particle velocimetry for microscale flows using volumetric scanning," We present a diagnostic platform for measuring three-dimensional three-component (3D3C) velocity fields in microscopic volumes. The imaging system uses high-speed Nipkow spinning disk confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy provides optical sectioning using pinhole spatial filtering which rejects light originating from out-of-focus objects. The system accomplishes volumetric scanning by rapid translation of the high numerical aperture objective using a piezo objective positioner. The motion of fluorescent microspheres is quantified using 3D3C super resolution particle-imaging velocimetry with instantaneous spatial resolutions of the order of 5 µm or less in all three dimensions. We examine 3D3C flow in a PDMS microchannel with an expanding section at 3D acquisition rates of 30 Hz, and find strong agreement with a computational model. Equations from the PIV and PTV literature adapted for a scanning objective provide estimates of maximum measurable velocity. The technique allows for isosurface visualization of 3D particle motion and robust high spatial resolution velocity measurements without requiring a calibration step or reconstruction algorithms.",14-Jun-12
8,Jeffrey Moran,Electrokinetic locomotion due to reaction-induced charge auto-electrophoresis,"Mitchell originally proposed that an asymmetric ion flux across an organism’s membrane could generate electric fields that drive locomotion. Although this locomotion mechanism was later rejected for some species of bacteria, engineered Janus particles have been realized that can swim due to ion fluxes generated by asymmetric electrochemical reactions. Here we present governing equations, scaling analyses and numerical simulations that describe the motion of bimetallic rod-shaped motors in hydrogen peroxide solutions due to reaction-induced charge auto-electrophoresis. The coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Stokes equations are numerically solved using Frumkin-corrected Butler–Volmer equations to represent electrochemical reactions at the rod surface. Our simulations show strong agreement with the scaling analysis and experiments. The analysis shows that electrokinetic locomotion results from electro-osmotic fluid slip around the nanomotor surface. The electroviscous flow is driven by electrical body forces which are generated from a coupling of a reaction-induced dipolar charge density distribution and the electric field it creates. The magnitude of the electroviscous velocity increases quadratically with the surface reaction rate for an uncharged motor, and linearly when the motor supports a finite surface charge.",13-Jun-11
9,Jeffrey Moran,Rapid Fabrication of Bimetallic Spherical Motors,"Catalytic bimetallic nanomotors can swim at 100 body lengths per second as well as pick up, haul, and release micrometer-scale cargo. The electrokinetic locomotion of bimetallic nanomotors is driven by the electrocatalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The motors are typically fabricated by electrodeposition-based template synthesis techniques that result in heterogeneous samples and require specialized knowledge of electrochemistry, a three-electrode potentiostat setup, cyanide-based chemistry, and porous membranes. This paper presents a rapid and facile method for fabrication of spherical bimetallic motors that only requires access to metal deposition equipment and commercially available microspheres. The resulting spherical motors swim at speeds comparable to rod-shaped motors with the same dimensions and composition. The spherical motors’ velocity increases with fuel concentration and decreasing diameter.",21-Jul-10
10,Jeffrey Moran,Locomotion of electrocatalytic nanomotors due to reaction induced charge autoelectrophoresis,"Bimetallic rod-shaped nanomotors swim autonomously in hydrogen peroxide solutions. Here, we present a scaling analysis, computational simulations, and experimental data that show that the nanomotor locomotion is driven by fluid slip around the nanomotor surface due to electrical body forces. The body forces are generated by a coupling of charge density and electric fields induced by electrochemical reactions occurring on the nanomotor surface. We describe the dependence of nanomotor motion on the nanomotor surface potential and reaction-driven flux.",23-Jun-10
11,Jeffrey Moran,Submicron scale patterning in sintered silica colloidal crystal films using a focused ion beam,"Focused ion beam milling is used to fabricate micron and submicron scale patterns in sintered silica colloidal crystal films. Rectangular cavities with both solid and porous boundaries, fluidic channels, and isolation of a small number of packed spheres are patterned. The ion beam can pattern sintered films of individual submicron size spheres and create patterns that cover up to 40 μm in less than 15 min. The experiments in this work indicate that the amount of redeposited material on the surface of a milled cavity determines whether the surface will be porous or solid.

0,Lisa Luo,A Review of the Literature on Social and Emotional Learning for Students Ages 3–8: Characteristics of Effective Social and Emotional Learning Programs,"The purpose of the report series is to summarize the benefits of social and emotional learning (SEL) in early childhood, and identify the characteristics of SEL interventions that are effective in school contexts. Responding to a need expressed by the Early Childhood Education Research Alliance, the research team conducted a systematic review and synthesis of recent research reviews and meta-analyses on the topic of SEL. The review identified effective SEL programs, strategies, and implementation practices. These effective components include aspects of program design, teacher training and technical assistance, and integration of SEL with existing structures. The review also described state and district policies that support SEL, such as engaging stakeholders, assessing resources and needs, adopting evidence-based SEL programs, integrating SEL into teacher and administrator evaluation systems, and developing comprehensive, freestanding SEL learning standards. Results suggest that SEL programs positively affect social and academic outcomes; however, more research is needed on the effects on diverse student groups.

The four parts to the series are:
Characteristics of effective social and emotional learning programs (part 1 of 4)
Implementation strategies and state and district support policies (part 2 of 4)
Teacher and classroom strategies that contribute to social and emotional learning (part 3 of 4)
Outcomes for different student populations and settings (part 4 of 4)",1-Feb-17
1,Lisa Luo,How Do States Define Alternative Education?,"This study provides an overview of similarities and differences in how states and state education agencies define alternative education, as well as which states have alternative education standards and what those standards entail. The study reviewed information on alternative education definitions and programs from state and federal websites and from local school system websites in Maryland. Findings show that 43 states and the District of Columbia have formal definitions of alternative education. The most commonly cited target population for alternative education is students with behavioral problems. The most common services listed in state definitions and policies regarding alternative education programs are regular academic instruction, counseling, social/life skills, job readiness, and behavioral services (e.g., anger management, conflict resolution). The literature suggests that the definition of alternative education should include the target population, services offered, setting (e.g., in school, stand-alone schools), and scheduling (e.g., during school hours, outside of school hours).",1-Sep-14

To address this problem, we present an approach for improving the security posture of distributed systems by examining the security impact of configuration changes across their interdependent components. We construct a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities and use it to analyze the attack surface and the impact of attacks. We show how the model can be optimized using SMT solvers to derive configurations that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality.",24-Feb-19
1,Massimiliano Albanese,DeBot: A Novel Network-based Mechanism to Detect Exfiltration by Architectural Stealthy Botnets,"Malicious actors use networks of compromised and remotely controlled hosts, known as botnets, to execute different classes of cyberattacks, including exfiltration of sensitive data. Recently, we have observed a trend toward more resilient botnet architectures, departing from traditional centralized architectures and enabling botnets to evade detection and persist in a system indefinitely. Botnets can achieve resilience through architectural stealth, by establishing overlay networks that minimize exposure of malicious traffic to detectors. To address this problem, we propose a novel network‐based detection scheme, called DeBot, which identifies traffic flows associated with exfiltration attempts. The proposed solution intercepts traffic from different monitoring points and leverages differences in the network behavior of botnets and benign users to identify suspicious flows. To this aim, we first develop a mechanism to identify monitoring points that are likely to intercept a significant volume of malicious traffic. Then, we analyze flow characteristics to identify suspicious hosts and use periodogram analysis to identify malicious flows originating from those hosts. We evaluate the proposed approach against different botnets in the CyberVAN testbed and compare its performance against state‐of‐the‐art detection techniques. The results indicate that DeBot is effective in detecting botnet activity, thus enabling the identification and removal of bots.",5-Dec-18
2,Massimiliano Albanese,From Cyber Situational Awareness to Adaptive Cyber Defense: Leveling the Cyber Playing Field,"In the cyber security landscape, the asymmetric relationship between defender and attacker tends to favor the attacker: while the defender needs to protect a system against all possible ways of breaching it, the attacker needs to identify and exploit only one vulnerable entry point in order to succeed. In this chapter, we show how we can effectively reverse such intrinsic asymmetry in favor of the defender by concurrently pursuing two complementary objectives: increasing the defender’s understanding of multiple facets of the cyber landscape – referred to as Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) – and creating uncertainty for the attacker through Moving Target Defense (MTD) or Adaptive Cyber Defense (ACD) techniques. This chapter provides a brief overview of contributions in these areas, and discusses future research directions.",30-Nov-18
3,Massimiliano Albanese,A Quantitative Framework to Model Advanced Persistent Threats,"In recent years, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have emerged as increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, often waged by state actors or other hostile organizations against high-profile targets. APT actors employ a diversified set of sophisticated tools and advanced capabilities to penetrate target systems, evade detection, and maintain a foothold within compromised systems for extended periods of time. Stealth and persistence enable APT actors to conduct long-term espionage and sabotage operations. Despite significant efforts to develop APT detection and mitigation capabilities, the stealthy nature of APTs poses significant challenges, and defending from such threats is still an open research problem. In particular, quantitative models to capture how APTs may create and maintain a foothold within a target system are lacking. To address this gap, we propose a quantitative framework to (i) assess the cost incurred by APT actors to compromise and persist within a target system; (ii) estimate the value they gain over time by persisting in the system; (iii) simulate how the footprint of an APT evolves over time when, to maintain stealth, attackers have constraints on the volume of potentially detectable activity they can engage in. We also propose a preliminary defender model, and results from the evaluation show that our approach is promising, thus encouraging further research in this direction. ",26-Jul-18
4,Massimiliano Albanese,Defending from Stealthy Botnets Using Moving Target Defenses,"In today’s IT landscape, organizations are increasingly exposed to an array of novel and sophisticated threats—including advanced persistent threats (APTs) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks—which can bypass traditional defenses and persist in target systems indefinitely. Threat actors often rely on networks of compromised and remotely controlled hosts, known as botnets, to execute a number of different cyberattacks and engage in criminal or unauthorized activities. Protecting sensitive and mission-critical data from competitors, state actors, and organized crime has become increasingly critical for the well-being of many organizations. A promising approach to botnet detection and mitigation relies on moving target defense (MTD), a novel and game-changing approach to cyber defense. MTD creates asymmetric uncertainty, providing the defender with a tactical advantage over the attacker. MTD techniques are designed to continuously change or shift a system’s attack surface, thus increasing cost and complexity for the threat actors. We show how the botnet detection and mitigation problem can be decomposed in three related and relatively simpler challenges, and how these challenges can be effectively tackled adopting an MTD approach, ultimately limiting the ability of a botnet to persist within a target system.",6-Feb-18
5,Massimiliano Albanese,A Graphical Model to Assess the Impact of Multi-Step Attacks,"In the last several decades, networked systems have grown in complexity and sophistication, introducing complex interdependencies amongst their numerous and diverse components. Attackers can leverage such interdependencies to penetrate seemingly well-guarded networks through sophisticated multi-step attacks. Research has shown that explicit and implicit interdependencies exist at various layers of the hardware and software architecture. In particular, dependencies between vulnerabilities and dependencies between applications and services are critical for assessing the impact of multi-step attacks. These two classes of interdependencies have been traditionally studied using attack and dependency graphs respectively. Although significant work has been done in the area of both attack and dependency graphs, we demonstrate that neither of these models can provide an accurate assessment of an attack’s impact, when used in isolation. To address this limitation, we take a mission-centric approach and present a solution to integrate these two powerful models into a unified framework that enables us to accurately assess the impact of multi-step attacks and identify high-impact attack paths within a network. This analysis can ultimately generate effective hardening recommendations, and can be seen as one phase of a continuous process that iteratively cycles through impact analysis and vulnerability remediation stages.",1-Jan-18
6,Massimiliano Albanese,Performance Modeling of Moving Target Defenses,"In recent years, Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a potential game changer in the security landscape, due to its potential to create asymmetric uncertainty  that favors the defender. Many  different MTD techniques have then been proposed, each addressing an often very specific set of attack vectors. Despite the huge progress made in this area, there are still some critical gaps with respect to the analysis and quantification of the cost and benefits of deploying MTD techniques. In fact, common metrics to assess the performance of these techniques are still lacking and most of them tend to assess their performance in different and often incompatible ways. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a quantitative analytic model for assessing the resource availability and performance of MTDs, and a method for the determination of the highest possible reconfiguration rate, and thus smallest probability of attacker's success, that meets performance and stability constraints. Finally, we present an experimental validation of the proposed approach.",30-Oct-17

10,Massimiliano Albanese,A Framework for Moving Target Defense Quantification,"Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a game changer in the security landscape, as it can create asymmetric uncertainty favoring the defender. Despite the significant work done in this area and the many different techniques that have been proposed, MTD has not yet gained widespread adoption due to several limitations. Specifically, interactions between multiple techniques have not been studied yet and a unified framework for quantifying and comparing very diverse techniques is still lacking. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to model how different MTD techniques can affect the information an attacker needs to exploit a system’s vulnerabilities, so as to introduce uncertainty and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks. We illustrate how this framework can be used to compare two sets of MTDs, and to select an optimal set of MTDs that maximize security within a given budget. Experimental results show that our approach is effective.",4-May-17
11,Massimiliano Albanese,From Idea to Prototype: Introducing Students to Entrepreneurship,"We describe results from a semester-long class taught by seven faculty at George Mason University, aimed at providing resources to engage students in idea generation, design cycle development, and finally elaboration of a business plan. This is intended to alleviate a perceived lack of access for students to commercialize their ideas. Undergraduate and graduate students are often left with unfinished class projects that do not turn into prototypes or products. Here we aim to avoid this outcome (often referred to as the “Valley of Death”). We recruited students with ideas for products as well as students with varied expertise. We have then formalized their engagement by offering a seminar class that met once every other week over a 15 week semester. After the class each team underwent a one-week intensive boot camp for a final demonstration and presentation of their product and business plan. Throughout the semester the teams solicited and received micro-grants, then used the financial support to acquire materials to prototype several iterations of their ideas. In this paper we present data from our preliminary analysis of two successful teams. Out of five teams who took the class, three completed, and two continued with their products beyond the class. We also discuss strategies to engage students, to form viable teams, to provide technical support, and to deliver content in a nontraditional environment, with students from different backgrounds (e.g., sociology, civil engineering, computer science) enrolled both in undergraduate and graduate programs.",11-Mar-17
12,Massimiliano Albanese,Moving Target Defense against DDoS Attacks: An Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis,"Distributed denial-of-service attacks are an increasing problem facing web applications, for which many defense techniques have been proposed, including several moving-target strategies. These strategies typically work by relocating targeted services over time, increasing uncertainty for the attacker, while trying not to disrupt legitimate users or incur excessive costs. Prior work has not shown, however, whether and how a rational defender would choose a moving-target method against an adaptive attacker, and under what conditions. We formulate a denial-of-service scenario as a two-player game, and solve a restricted-strategy version of the game using the methods of empirical game-theoretic analysis. Using agent-based simulation, we evaluate the performance of strategies from prior literature under a variety of attacks and environmental conditions. We find evidence for the strategic stability of various proposed strategies, such as proactive server movement, delayed attack timing, and suspected insider blocking, along with guidelines for when each is likely to be most effective.",10-Oct-16
13,Massimiliano Albanese,A Moving Target Defense Approach to Disrupting Stealthy Botnets,"Botnets are increasingly being used for exfiltrating sensitive data from mission-critical systems. Research has shown that botnets have become extremely sophisticated and can operate in stealth mode by minimizing their host and network footprint. In order to defeat exfiltration by modern botnets,
we propose a moving target defense approach for dynamically deploying detectors across a network. Specifically, we propose several strategies based on centrality measures to periodically change the placement of detectors. Our objective is to increase the attacker's effort and likelihood of detection by creating uncertainty about the location of detectors and forcing botmasters to perform additional
actions in an attempt to create detector-free paths through the network. We present metrics to evaluate the proposed strategies and an algorithm to compute a lower bound on the detection probability. We validate our approach through simulations, and results conrm that the proposed solution effectively reduces the likelihood of successful exfiltration campaigns.",10-Oct-16
14,Massimiliano Albanese,Next-Generation Technologies for Preventing Accidental Death of Children Trapped in Parked Vehicles,"Integration of computational and physical elements into cyber-physical systems is increasingly finding application in a number of different domains, including smart power grids, medical technologies, and building automation. In this paper, we study how the notion of cyber-physical
integration can be applied to the design of the next generation of safety devices for saving the life of children inadvertently left into parked vehicles. In the United States alone, an average 38 children die from heatstroke after being left into parked vehicles by their caregivers. To be effective, next-generation safety devices will need to have the capability of sensing the environment in and around the vehicle, integrating and processing data from an array of different sensors, assessing the risk in real time, and triggering appropriate corrective actions aimed
at removing or mitigating the risk factors for the child. ",14-Aug-14
15,Massimiliano Albanese,Automated Coding of Decision Support Variables,"With the enormous amount of textual information now available online, there is an increasing demand – especially in the national security community – for tools capable of automatically extracting certain types of information from massive amounts of raw data. In the last several years, ad-hoc Information Extraction (IE) systems have been developed to help address this need [6]. However, there are applications where the types of questions that need to be answered are far more complex than those that traditional IE systems can handle, and require to integrate information from several sources. For instance, political scientists need to monitor political organizations and conflicts, while defense and security analysts need to monitor terrorist groups. Typically, political scientists and analysts define a long list of variables – referred to as “codebook” – that they want to monitor over time for a number of groups. Currently, in most such efforts, the task of finding the right value for each variable – denoted as “coding” – is performed manually by human coders, and is extremely time consuming. Thus, the need for automation is enormous.

In this paper, we present an improved contention-resolving MPC design. We propose a new branch cost formulation for the decision tree that is constructed by contention-resolving MPC to handle the case where a vehicle is delayed multiple times before being allowed access to the intersection. All possible priority combinations are dynamically generated when constructing the decision tree. Based on the priority assignments, we design a decentralized control law to control vehicle speeds, which we show enjoys optimality properties under a specific priority assignment.

Using the Rescorla-Wagner model for human learning, we analyze an expert based online learning algorithm and identify an invariant set in the state and parameter space where chatter will occur.

GT-MAB is safe while flying in close proximity to humans. It is able to detect the face of a human subject, follow the human, and recognize hand gestures. GT-MAB employs a deep neural network based on the single shot multibox detector to jointly detect a human users face and hands in a real-time video stream collected by the onboard camera. A human-robot interaction procedure is designed and tested with various human users. The learning algorithms recognize two hand waving gestures. The human user does not need to wear any additional tracking device when interacting with the flying blimp. Vision-based feedback controllers are designed to control the blimp to follow the human and fly in one of two distinguishable patterns in response to each of the two hand gestures. The blimp communicates its intentions to the human user by displaying visual symbols. The collected experimental data show that the visual feedback from the blimp in reaction to the human user significantly improves the interactive experience between blimp and human. The demonstrated success of this procedure indicates that GT-MAB could serve as a flying robot that is able to collect human data safely in an indoor environment.",8-Jan-19

We formulate the intersection scheduling problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem which co-designs the priority and traveling speed for each vehicle. The co-design aims to minimize the vehicle waiting time at the intersection area, under a set of safety constraints. To solve the problem, we present a contention-resolving Model Predictive Control (MPC) method to dynamically assign priorities and compute the optimal speed for each vehicle based on the assigned priorities.

We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and battery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and constraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time scheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid, named significant moments analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments when electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a dynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA, we can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can generate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case where the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide accurate information about the amount of insufficient power and the time when the insufficiency happens. Simulated results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed analysis method.",1-Sep-17
6,Ningshi Yao,Monocular vision-based human following on miniature robotic blimpMonocular vision-based human following on miniature robotic blimp,"We present an approach that allows the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimp (GT-MAB) to detect and follow a human. This accomplishment is the first Human Robot Interaction (HRI) demonstration between an uninstrumented human and a robotic blimp. GT-MAB is an ideal platform for HRI missions because it is safe to humans and can support sufficient flight time for HRI experiments. However, due to complex aerodynamic influence on the blimp, the human following task for GT-MAB with a single on-board camera is a challenging problem. We integrate Haar face detector and KLT feature tracker to achieve robust human tracking. After a human face is detected in the real-time video stream, we estimated the 3D positions of the human with respect to GT-MAB. Visionbased PID controllers are designed based on estimated relative position and the motion primitives of GT-MAB such that it can achieve stable and continuous human following behavior. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the human following capability on GT-MAB.",29-May-17
7,Ningshi Yao,Contention resolving optimal priority assignment for event-triggered model predictive controllersContention resolving optimal priority assignment for event-triggered model predictive controllers,"Priority-based scheduling strategies are often used to resolve contentions in resource constrained networked control systems (NCSs). Such scheduling strategies inevitably introduce time delays into controls. Considering the coupling between priority assignment and control, this paper proposes a novel method to co-design priority assignments and controls for each control loop in NCSs. The co-design aims to minimize the performance degradation caused by time delays. The priority assignment is determined by a path planning approach to search for optimal priority assignments. Model predictive controllers are designed based on optimizing priority assignments to compute optimal controls. Simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",24-May-17

This model allows us to mimic the effect of nanoparticles on the transmembrane potential, by decreasing the permeability of potassium ion channels. We show that our model agrees with the trends observed in our experiments. However, it also exhibits opposing trends under certain conditions, which were not seen in the experiments. This indicates that the membrane potential can be bistable. We analyze the cellular conditions which may cause this apparent bistability. The effects of adding nanoparticles on sodium and chloride ion channels are also studied using the proposed model. We hypothesize that nanoparticles may also block the sodium and chloride ion channels but the extent of blockage of these ion channels may differ from that of potassium ion channels.",6-Jul-16
0,Parag Chitnis,Correlation of rupture dynamics to the nonlinear backscatter response from polymer-shelled ultrasound contrast agents," Polymer-shelled ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) may expel their encapsulated gas subject to ultrasound- induced shell buckling or rupture. Nonlinear oscillations of this gas bubble can produce a subharmonic component in the ultrasound backscatter. This study investigated the relationship between this gas-release mechanism and shell-thickness??? to???radius ratios (STRRs) of polymer-shelled UCAs. Three types of polylactide-shelled UCAs with STRRs of 7.5, 40, and 100 nm/??m were studied. Each UCA population had a nominal mean diameter of 2 ??m. UCAs were subjected to increasing static overpressure ranging from 2 to 330 kPa over a duration of 2 h in a custom-designed test chamber while being imaged using a 200?? magnification video microscope at a frame rate of 5 frames/s. Digitized video images were binarized and processed to obtain the cross-sectional area of individual UCAs. Integration of the normalized cross-sectional area over normalized time, defined as buckling factor (Bf), provided a dimensionless parameter for quantifying and comparing the degree of pre-rupture buckling exhibited by the UCAs of different STRRs in response to overpressure. The UCAs with an STRR of 7.5 nm/??m exhibited a distinct shell-buckling phase before shell rupture (Bf < 1), whereas the UCAs with higher STRRs (40 and 100 nm/??m) did not undergo significant prerupture buckling (Bf ??? 1). The difference in the overpressure response was correlated with the subharmonic response produced by these UCAs. When excited using 20-MHz ultrasound, individual UCAs (N = 3000) in populations that did not exhibit a buckling phase produced a subharmonic response that was an order of magnitude greater than the UCA population with a prominent pre-rupture buckling phase. These results indicate the mechanism of gas expulsion from these UCAs might be a relevant factor in determining the level of subharmonic response in response to high-frequency ultrasound ",1-Mar-15
0,Ran Ji,"Properties, formulations, and algorithms for portfolio optimization using Mean-Gini criteria","We study an extended set of Mean-Gini portfolio optimization models that encompasses a general version of the mean-risk formulation, the Minimal Gini model (MinG) that minimizes Gini’s Mean Differences, and the new risk-adjusted Mean-Gini Ratio (MGR) model. We analyze the properties of the various models, prove that a performance measure based on a Risk Adjusted version of the Mean Gini Ratio (RAMGR) is coherent, and establish the equivalence between maximizing this performance measure and solving for the maximal Mean-Gini ratio. We propose a linearization approach for the fractional programming formulation of the MGR model. We also conduct a thorough evaluation of the various Mean-Gini models based on four data sets that represent combinations of bullish and bearish scenarios in the in-sample and out-of-sample phases. The performance is (i) analyzed with respect to eight return, risk, and risk-adjusted criteria, (ii) benchmarked with the S&P500 index, and (iii) compared with their Mean-Variance counterparts for varying risk aversion levels and with the Minimal CVaR and Minimal Semi-Deviation models. For the data sets used in our study, our results suggest that the various Mean-Gini models almost always result in solutions that outperform the S&P500 benchmark index with respect to the out-of-sample cumulative return. Further, particular instances of Mean-Gini models result in solutions that are as good or better (for example, MinG in bullish in-sample scenarios, and MGR in bearish out-of-sample scenarios) than the solutions obtained with their counterparts in Mean-Variance, Minimal CVaR and Minimal Semi-Deviation models.",Annals of Operations Research
1,Ran Ji,Risk-budgeting multi-portfolio optimization with portfolio and marginal risk constraints,"Multi-portfolio optimization problems and the incorporation of marginal risk contribution constraints have recently received a sustained interest from academia and financial practitioners. We propose a class of new stochastic risk budgeting multi-portfolio optimization models that impose portfolio as well as marginal risk constraints. The models permit the simultaneous and integrated optimization of multiple sub-portfolios in which the marginal risk contribution of each individual security is accounted for. A risk budget defined with a downside risk measure is allocated to each security. We consider the two cases in which the asset universes of the sub-portfolios are either disjoint (diversification of style) or overlap (diversification of judgment). The proposed models take the form of stochastic programming problems and include each a probabilistic constraint with multi-row random technology matrix. We expand a combinatorial modeling framework to represent the feasible set of the chance constraints first as a set of mixed-integer linear inequalities. The new reformulation proposed in this paper is much sparser than previously presented reformulations and allows the efficient solution of problem instances that could not be solved otherwise. We evaluate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed method that is general enough to be applied to general chance-constrained optimization problems. We conduct a cross-validation study via a rolling-horizon procedure to assess the performance of the models, and understand the impact of the parameters and diversification types on the portfolios.",Annals of Operations Research

Due to the lack of women in technology, many efforts are being made to expose girls to computer programming at an early age. Code camp organizers are using the all-girl model to help put participants more at ease and boost their computing confidence. High computer self-efficacy leads to studying computer science, while the stereotypical views of coding as a male subject and lack of ability in girls hinder women from pursuing CS degrees. For this study, a local Northern Virginia University offered two Java programming summer code camps in the summer of 2016, one course as an all-girl class and the other as a co-ed environment. A total of 19 girls participated and submitted post-workshop survey responses. In this paper, we explore the questionnaire differences in response between the girls within the two groups.

0,Shani Ross,Chronic monitoring of lower urinary tract activity via a sacral dorsal root ganglia interface,"Objective. Our goal is to develop an interface that integrates chronic monitoring of lower urinary tract (LUT) activity with stimulation of peripheral pathways. Approach. Penetrating microelectrodes were implanted in sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult male felines. Peripheral electrodes were placed on or in the pudendal nerve, bladder neck and near the external urethral sphincter. Supra-pubic bladder catheters were implanted for saline infusion and pressure monitoring. Electrode and catheter leads were enclosed in an external housing on the back. Neural signals from microelectrodes and bladder pressure of sedated or awake-behaving felines were recorded under various test conditions in weekly sessions. Electrodes were also stimulated to drive activity. Main results. LUT single- and multi-unit activity was recorded for 4–11 weeks in four felines. As many as 18 unique bladder pressure single-units were identified in each experiment. Some channels consistently recorded bladder afferent activity for up to 41 d, and we tracked individual single-units for up to 23 d continuously. Distension-evoked and stimulation-driven (DRG and pudendal) bladder emptying was observed, during which LUT sensory activity was recorded. Significance. This chronic implant animal model allows for behavioral studies of LUT neurophysiology and will allow for continued development of a closed-loop neuroprosthesis for bladder control.",4-May-17
1,Shani Ross,Hysteretic behavior of bladder afferent neurons in response to changes in bladder pressure,"Background
Mechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises. However, the relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is not a simple linear one. Firing rate responses to pressure can differ depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system. Though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it has not been quantified.

Results
Sixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.2) during saline infusion (2 ml/min). For saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range (or Hmax) of 0.86 ± 0.09 (mean ± standard deviation) and mean hysteresis ratio (or Hmean) of 0.52 ± 0.13 (n = 46 afferents). For isovolumetric trials in two experiments (n = 33 afferents) Hmax was 0.72 ± 0.14 and Hmean was 0.40 ± 0.14.

Conclusions
A comprehensive state model that integrates these hysteresis parameters to determine the bladder state may improve upon existing neuroprostheses for bladder control.",12-Aug-16
2,Shani Ross,Deep Brain Stimulation in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala Decreases “Wanting” and “Liking” of Food Reward,"We investigated the potential of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in rats to modulate functional reward mechanisms. The CeA is the major output of the amygdala with direct connections to the hypothalamus and gustatory brainstem, and indirect connections with the nucleus accumbens. Further, the CeA has been shown to be involved in learning, emotional integration, reward processing, and regulation of feeding. We hypothesized that DBS, which is used to treat movement disorders and other brain dysfunctions, might block reward motivation. In rats performing a lever-pressing task to obtain sugar pellet rewards, we stimulated the CeA and control structures, and compared stimulation parameters. During CeA stimulation, animals stopped working for rewards and rejected freely available rewards. Taste reactivity testing during DBS exposed aversive reactions to normally liked sucrose tastes and even more aversive taste reactions to normally disliked quinine tastes. Interestingly, given the opportunity, animals implanted in the CeA would self-stimulate with 500 ms trains of stimulation at the same frequency and current parameters as continuous stimulation that would stop reward acquisition. Neural recordings during DBS showed that CeA neurons were still active and uncovered inhibitory-excitatory patterns after each stimulus pulse indicating possible entrainment of the neural firing with DBS. In summary, DBS modulation of CeA may effectively usurp normal neural activity patterns to create an ‘information lesion’ that not only decreased motivational ‘wanting’ of food rewards, but also blocked ‘liking’ of rewards.",5-Aug-16

4,Shani Ross,Laminar Analysis of Movement Direction Information in Local Field Potentials of the Rat Motor Cortex,"Local field potentials (LFPs) have been proposed for use in controlling neural prosthetic devices because they can provide reliable motor and sensory-related information, and can easily be recorded over long periods of time. While studies have shown that directional information about motor movements can be inferred from LFPs, it is not known at what depth these signals should be recorded from in order to maximize the amount of movement information. Towards this end, we used a directional motor task in Long Evans rats, while sampling LFPs with an electrode consisting of 16 vertical recording sites that were evenly-spaced 100 microm apart. This allowed for simultaneous recording of all layers of the motor cortex. The frequency components of LFPs were then analyzed using k-means clustering to determine directional information as a function of depth. Here we report our initial findings that superficial layers (II/III) of motor cortex may provide more information about movement directions then deeper layers (V).",30-Aug-06

0,Yue Cheng,Improving Docker Registry Design based on Production Workload Analysis,"Containers offer an efficient way to run workloads as independent microservices that can be developed, tested and deployed in an agile manner. To facilitate this process, container frameworks offer a registry service that enables users to publish and version container images and share them with others. The registry service plays a critical role in the startup time of containers since many container starts entail the retrieval of container images from a registry. To support research efforts on optimizing the registry service, large-scale and realistic traces are required. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive characterization of a large-scale registry workload based on traces that we collected over the course of 75 days from five IBM data centers hosting production-level registries. We present a trace replayer to perform our analysis and infer a number of crucial insights about container workloads, such as request type distribution, access patterns, and response times. Based on these insights, we derive design implications for the registry and demonstrate their ability to improve performance.

1,Yue Cheng,MOS: Workload-aware Elasticity for Cloud Object Stores,"The use of cloud object stores has been growing rapidly in recent years as they combine key advantages such as HTTP-based RESTful APIs, high availability, elasticity with a “pay-as-you-go” pricing model that allows applications to scale as needed. The current practice is to either use a single set of configuration parameters or rely on statically configured storage policies for a cloud object store deployment, even when the store is used to support different types of applications with evolving requirements. This crucial mismatch between the different applications requirements and capabilities of the object store is problematic and should be addressed to achieve high efficiency and performance.

In this paper, we propose MOS, a Micro Object Storage architecture, which supports independently configured microstores each tuned dynamically to the needs of a particular type of workload. We also design an enhancement, MOS++ , that extends MOS’s capabilities through fine-grained resource management to effectively meet the tenants’ SLAs while maximizing resource efficiency. We have implemented a prototype of MOS ++ in OpenStack Swift using Docker containers. Our evaluation shows that MOS ++ can effectively support heterogeneous workloads across multiple tenants. Compared to default and statically configured object store setups, for a two-tenant setup, MOS++ improves the sustained access bandwidth by up to 79% for a large-object workload, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by up to 70.2% for a small-object workload.",2-Jun-16
2,Yue Cheng,Taming the Cloud Object Stores with MOS," Cloud object stores today are deployed using a single set of configuration parameters for all different types of applications. This homogeneous setup results in all applications experiencing the same service level (e.g., data transfer throughput, etc.). However, the vast variety of applications expose extremely different latency and throughput requirements. To this end, we propose MOS, a <u>M</u>icro <u>O</u>bject <u>S</u>torage architecture with independently configured microstores each tuned dynamically for a particular type of workload. We then expose these microstores to the tenant who can then choose to place their data in the appropriate microstore according the latency and throughput requirements of their workloads. Our evaluation shows that compared with default setup, MOS can improve the performance up to 200% for small objects and 28% for large objects while providing opportunity of tradeoff between two.

3,Yue Cheng,Pricing Games for Hybrid Object Stores in the Cloud: Provider vs. Tenant," Cloud object stores are increasingly becoming the de facto storage choice for big data analytics platforms, mainly because they simplify the management of large blocks of data at scale. To ensure cost-effectiveness of the storage service, the object stores use hard disk drives (HDDs). However, the lower performance of HDDs affect tenants who have strict performance requirements for their big data applications. The use of faster storage devices such as solid state drives (SSDs) is thus desirable by the tenants, but incurs significant maintenance costs to the provider. We design a tiered object store for the cloud, which comprises both fast and slow storage devices. The resulting hybrid store exposes the tiering to tenants with a dynamic pricing model that is based on the tenants’ usage and the provider’s desire to maximize profits. The tenants leverage knowledge of their workloads and current pricing information to select a data placement strategy that would meet the application requirements at the lowest cost. Our approach allows both a service provider and its tenants to engage in a pricing game, which our results show yields a win–win situation. ",1-Jul-15
4,Yue Cheng,CAST: Tiering Storage for Data Analytics in the Cloud,"Enterprises are increasingly moving their big data analytics to the cloud with the goal of reducing costs without sacrificing application performance. Cloud service providers offer their tenants a myriad of storage options, which while flexible, makes the choice of storage deployment non trivial. Crafting deployment scenarios to leverage these choices in a cost-effective manner under the unique pricing models and multi-tenancy dynamics of the cloud environment — presents unique challenges in designing cloud-based data analytics frameworks.

In this paper, we propose Cast, a Cloud Analytics Storage Tiering solution that cloud tenants can use to reduce monetary cost and improve performance of analytics workloads. The approach takes the first step towards providing storage tiering support for data analytics in the cloud. Cast performs offline workload profiling to construct job performance prediction models on different cloud storage services, and combines these models with workload specifications and high-level tenant goals to generate a cost-effective data placement and storage provisioning plan. Furthermore, we build Cast++ to enhance Cast’s optimization model by incorporating data reuse patterns and across-jobs interdependencies common in realistic analytics workloads.",1-Jun-15
5,Yue Cheng,An In-Memory Object Caching Framework with Adaptive Load Balancing,"The extreme latency and throughput requirements of modern web applications are driving the use of distributed in-memory object caches such as Memcached. While extant caching systems scale-out seamlessly, their use in the cloud --- with its unique cost and multi-tenancy dynamics --- presents unique opportunities and design challenges.

In this paper, we propose MBal, a high-performance in-memory object caching framework with adaptive <u>M</u>ultiphase load <u>B</u>alancing, which supports not only horizontal (scale-out) but vertical (scale-up) scalability as well. MBal is able to make efficient use of available resources in the cloud through its fine-grained, partitioned, lockless design. This design also lends itself naturally to provide adaptive load balancing both within a server and across the cache cluster through an event-driven, multi-phased load balancer. While individual load balancing approaches are being lever-aged in in-memory caches, MBal goes beyond the extant systems and offers a holistic solution wherein the load balancing model tracks hotspots and applies different strategies based on imbalance severity -- key replication, server-local or cross-server coordinated data migration. Performance evaluation on an 8-core commodity server shows that compared to a state-of-the-art approach, MBal scales with number of cores and executes 2.3x and 12x more queries/second for GET and SET operations, respectively.",1-Apr-15
6,Yue Cheng,ClusterOn: Building Highly Configurable and Reusable Clustered Data Services using Simple Data Nodes,"The growing variety of data storage and retrieval needs is driving the design and development of an increasing number of distributed storage applications such as key-value stores, distributed file systems, object stores, and databases. We observe that, to a large extent, such applications would implement their own way of handling features of data replication, failover, consistency, cluster topology, leadership election, etc. We found that 45--82% of the code in six popular distributed storage applications can be classified as implementations of such common features. While such implementations allow for deeper optimizations tailored for a specific application, writing new applications to satisfy the ever-changing requirements of new types of data or I/O patterns is challenging, as it is notoriously hard to get all the features right in a distributed setting.

In this paper, we argue that for most modern storage applications, the common feature implementation (i.e., the distributed part) can be automated and offloaded, so developers can focus on the core application functions. We are designing a framework, ClusterOn, which aims to take care of the messy plumbing of distributed storage applications. The envisioned goal is that a developer simply ""drops"" a non-distributed application into ClusterOn, which will convert it into a scalable and highly configurable distributed application.

7,Yue Cheng,Erasing Belady's Limitations: In Search of Flash Cache Offline Optimality,"NAND-based solid-state (flash) drives are known for providing better performance than magnetic disk drives, but they have limits on endurance, the number of times data can be erased and overwritten. Furthermore, the unit of erasure can be many times larger than the basic unit of I/O; this leads to complexity with respect to consolidating live data and erasing obsolete data. When flash drives are used as a cache for a larger, disk-based storage system, the choice of a cache replacement algorithm can make a significant difference in both performance and endurance. While there are many cache replacement algorithms, their effectiveness is hard to judge due to the lack of a baseline against which to compare them: Belady’s MIN, the usual offline best-case algorithm, considers read hit ratio but not endurance. 

We explore offline algorithms for flash caching in terms of both hit ratio and flash lifespan. We design and implement a multi-stage heuristic by synthesizing several techniques that manage data at the granularity of a flash erasure unit (which we call a container) to approximate the offline optimal algorithm. We find that simple techniques contribute most of the available erasure savings. Our evaluation shows that the container-optimized offline heuristic is able to provide the same optimal read hit ratio as MIN with 67% fewer flash erasures. More fundamentally, our investigation provides a useful approximate baseline for evaluating any online algorithm, highlighting the importance of comparing new policies for caching compound blocks in flash.",USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC '16)
