During my time at Brown I was fortunate to spent a semester at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA working in the Cryptography group with Melissa Chase and a summer at IBM Research in Zurich working as a member of the Cryptography and Security group. From 2014 to 2016 I was a postdoctoral researcher in the BU Security group at Boston University and also had a research affiliation with the Crypto.Sec group in University of Athens.

153,Yue Wang,"I am currently a Research Assistant Professor with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, George Mason University, VA, USA, where I was a Postdoctoral Researcher. Prior to that, I was a Senior Research Engineer with HiSilicon Research Department at Huawei Technologies Co, Ltd. My general interest lies in the areas of signal processing, wireless communications, machine learning, and their applications in cyber physical systems. Specific research focuses on sparse signal processing (compressive sensing and sparse optimization); next generation communications (mmWave, massive MIMO, NOMA, channel estimation, noncoherent transmission); array and statistical signal processing (DoA estimation, frequency analysis, statistical analysis), cognitive radio (wideband spectrum sensing, cooperative detection, compressive statistics sensing, RFI detection, spectrum coexistence); distributed learning (communication-efficient decentralized learning, federated learning, mobile edge computing); efficient large-scale cyber physical systems (big data for 5G, smart cities, massive IoTs, WSN)."
162,Zhisheng Yan,"My research interests broadly lie in the broad areas of mobile and networked systems. My current focus includes the security and network issues of immersive computing systems, such as AR, VR, imaging, and video systems.
